   ```

+ will add in future(coming soon)
  
5. Create a Bot token and paste in `.env`: 
   + Create a `.env` file. You can look at the `.env.example` to see how it should be, or copy this and paste this code into the `.env`
   ```s
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN="<Paste your token>"
   ```
   + Open Telegram and enter in the search field: `@BotFather`.
   + Go to `/newbot` than write bot's name and than choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot
   + You will have this message: Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at `t.me/your_bot`. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

     Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    `YOUR_API`

     Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

     For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
